          <h1>Our Services</h1>
          <p>
            We are a full-service painting contractor serving our client need.
            Our skilled painters provide residential and commercial interior
            painting services and exterior painting services to homeowners,
            apartment complexes, property management companies and other
            businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also help you by taking on an incomplete DIY project or a
            job that another painting contractor may have started but wasn't
            performing to your expectations. We've seen some unfortunate
            missteps and are happy to come in and fix or finish a project that
            got off to a bad start.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know that most homeowners don't take the decision to go through
            with a major house painting project lightly. We work closely with
            our customers to ensure satisfaction. Our talented and qualified
            painters will help you get the look and feel you want. We will
            happily answer any questions you may have throughout the process. We
            are a painting contractor that wants to work with you on scheduling.
            We will create a schedule that best accommodates your life.

          <h2>Interior Commercial Painting</h2>
          <p>
            At PLUS BUILDERS we've got the experience and expertise to have your
            commercial building looking great, whether it's a new build, a
            remodel or just a retouch. Due to the more complicated systems a
            commercial building includes, painting can be tricky. We'll have no
            problem handling any challenges and can apply any wall coverings or
            coatings beyond paint, if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your project is a retouch or repaint in a space that is full of
            furnishings and/or equipment, you can be sure that the team here at
            PLUS BUILDERS will take the same great care we do with our
            residential projects. We are very conscientious when it comes to
            being clean and tidy. We keep our work area contained and complete a
            full clean-up quickly after finishing the project.
          </p>
          <h2>Exterior Commercial Painting</h2>
          <p>
            Building height and design materials are just two of many details
            that make exterior painting of commercial buildings so complex. It's
            critically important that any painter taking on a commercial
            exterior painting project uses the proper coatings, materials and
            application equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            No two commercial exterior painting projects are alike and we will
            factor in all of the details of your building to do the job right
            the first time. We are very efficient and will work with you on a
            budget and timeline to fit your needs. We know that these types of
            projects can present challenges when a building is in operation and
            we will do whatever we can to minimize the impact, and/or complete
            work during non-operational hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll pay close attention to staging, weatherproofing and all the
            other special aspects of a commercial exterior painting job. You can
            count on us to be professional and tidy, and to conduct a full
            clean-up quickly after finishing the project. We can work directly
            with the commercial building owner or with a general contractor on a
            broader project.
          </p>
          <h2>Interior House Painting</h2>
          <p>
            At PLUS BUILDERS we know that interior house painting is a very
            personal decision for most homeowners. When you choose to work with
            us, our interior house painters will make sure the color goes on
            beautifully and presents the look you want for your home. Whether
            it's your kitchen, living room, dining room, bathrooms, bedrooms, or
            the entire interior of your house, you can trust PLUS BUILDERS to do
            an excellent job. We do small jobs and large jobs regardless of the
            size of your project and we will give you the service you deserve.
            Choosing a paint color can be a challenging experience for a
            homeowner. We are aware of that and our house painters are happy to
            help you make the right choice for your home. One of the most
            important, but often overlooked, aspects of an interior house
            painting project is the prep work that is done before a paint brush
            is even dipped in paint. We pay close attention to that important
            prep work that will ensure a high-quality result.
          </p>
          <h2>Exterior House Painting</h2>
          <p>
            You never get a second chance to make a first impression. If it's
            time to repaint your home's exterior, give PLUS BUILDERS a call. Sun
            exposure and weather can wear down the paint on the exterior of your
            home. Whether you are unhappy with the look of your house, want to
            be the best-looking place in the neighborhood, or if you want to
            improve your home's value before it goes on the market, you can
            trust PLUS BUILDERS to do an excellent job. We'll apply our
            expertise in exterior house painting to have your home looking like
            new. We'll be honored to have the opportunity to paint your house,
            so you can count on us to be professional and tidy, and to conduct a
            full clean-up quickly after finishing the project. We are also
            flexible and efficient, so we can work when it's most convenient for
            you and get the job done quickly with a high level of quality.
